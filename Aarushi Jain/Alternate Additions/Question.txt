Problem
Chef has 22 numbers AA and BB (A \lt B)(A<B).

Chef will perform some operations on AA.

In the i^{th}i 
th
  operation:

Chef will add 11 to AA if ii is odd.
Chef will add 22 to AA if ii is even.
Chef can stop at any instant. Can Chef make AA equal to BB?

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer TT â€” the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space separated integers AA and BB.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if Chef can make AA and BB equal, NO otherwise.

Note that the checker is case-insensitive. So, YES, Yes, yEs are all considered same.
