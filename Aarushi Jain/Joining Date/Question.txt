Problem
NN candidates (numbered from 11 to NN) join Chef's firm. The first 55 candidates join on the first day, and then, on every subsequent day, the next 55 candidates join in.
For example, if there are 1212 candidates, candidates numbered 11 to 55 will join on day 11, candidates numbered 66 to 1010 on day 22 and the remaining 22 candidates will join on day 33.

Candidate numbered KK decided to turn down his offer and thus, Chef adjusts the position by shifting up all the higher numbered candidates. This leads to a change in the joining day of some of the candidates.

Help Chef determine the number of candidates who will join on a different day than expected.

Input Format
First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, two space-separated integers NN and KK denoting the number of candidates and the candidate who turned down the offer.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer denoting the number of candidates whose joining day will be changed.
