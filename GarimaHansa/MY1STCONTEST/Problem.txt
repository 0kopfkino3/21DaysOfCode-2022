In a contest where N new users visited the contest,

A users just saw the problems and didn’t make any submissions and hence won’t get any rating.
B users who made a submission but could not solve any problem correctly. Thus, after the contest, they will get a rating in the range 800 - 1000800−1000.
Everyone else could correctly solve at least 11 problem. Thus, they will get a rating strictly greater than 10001000 after the contest.
You need to output the number of new users in the contest who, after the contest, will get a rating and also the number of new users who will get a rating strictly greater than 10001000.
