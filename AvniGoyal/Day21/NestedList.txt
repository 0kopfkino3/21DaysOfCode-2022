Given the names and grades for each student in a class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

Example: record=[["chi",20.0],["beta",50.0],["alpha",50.0]

The ordered list of scores is [20,50] , so the second lowest score is 50. There are two students with that score: ["beta","alpha"]. Ordered alphabetically, the names are printed as:
alpha beta
