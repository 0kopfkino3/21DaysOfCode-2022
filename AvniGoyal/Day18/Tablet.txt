Chef decided to buy a new tablet. His budget is BB, so he cannot buy a tablet whose price is greater than BB. Other than that, he only has one criterion â€” the area of the tablet's screen should be as large as possible. Of course, the screen of a tablet is always a rectangle.

Chef has visited some tablet shops and listed all of his options. In total, there are NN available tablets, numbered 11 through NN. For each valid ii, the ii-th tablet has width W_iW 
, height H_iH and price P_i
Help Chef choose a tablet which he should buy and find the area of such a tablet's screen, or determine that he cannot buy any tablet.
